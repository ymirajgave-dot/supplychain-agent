Today we reviewed the current challenges in supply chain planning. 
The group noted that forecast accuracy is only around 65%, leading to frequent mismatches between demand and supply. 
One of the managers raised concern about the lack of visibility in lead times, particularly in the APAC region. 
We also discussed the need for scenario planning in case of supply shocks or demand surges.

Next, the team aligned on creating a small prototype that can integrate SAP data into Snowflake staging. 
This prototype will test KPIs like OTIF, lead time variability, and service levels. 
A Power BI view should be prepared to present results to leadership. 
Follow-ups: validate data quality, define ownership of KPIs, and schedule another check-in two weeks later.
